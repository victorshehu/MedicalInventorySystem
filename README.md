"# MedicalInventorySystem" 
This is a project I worked on for Liberty University's School of Nursing's Simulation Center
It was aimed at  aiding effective location of items within the department.

If you want to use the database I used for configuration, email me (vshehu360@gmail.com) and I will send you the config.php file
A life version of the project is avaliable at http://victorshehu.com/MedicalInventorySystem/index.html
